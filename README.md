# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This Unity project, developed in C#, designed to visualize sorting algorithms. Features the main 5 comparative sorting algorithms. Each algorithm is meticulously implemented to provide a step-by-step visual representation of its sorting process. The project utilizes a simple color-changing system to highlight comparisons, swaps, and pivots during the sorting process. For more complex algorithms, a stack-based marking system was implemented, allowing for clear visualization of recursive calls and partitioning steps. The visualizer generates unique sound effects based on the values being compared. Common initial conditions were implemented to illustrate how effective algorithms for various conditions and showcase the fact there is no best sorting algorithm. The project is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy integration of additional sorting algorithms and features.
